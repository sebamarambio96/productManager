# Backend Project with Focus on Architecture and Advanced Tools

This project is aimed at showcasing my backend development skills using a variety of advanced tools.

## Project Architecture

The project architecture is based on a DAO (Data Access Object) approach, utilizing the following components:

- **DAO:** Data Access Object.
- **Repository:** Manages data access and storage.
- **Controller:** Handles request processing and response generation.
- **Services:** Contains business logic and application-specific functionality.
- **Models:** Defines data structures and represents the business entities.
- **Router:** Directs incoming requests to the appropriate controller.

Additionally, the project includes the following elements:

- **Entities:** Representing the core business objects.
- **Error Handler:** A global error handler that captures errors and ensures a consistent response.
- **Environment Variables:** Utilizing environment variables for configuration.
- **Configurable Logging System:** A logging system that is configurable, providing insights into the system's behavior and issues.

This structured approach ensures clear and modular code organization, facilitating system maintenance and scalability.
